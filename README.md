## 🌍 Overview — Turkey Trip

Turkey is a country with an exceptionally rich and layered history. From the **Hittites**, **Ancient Greeks**, and the **Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire**, to the long-lasting **Ottoman Empire**, the land of **Anatolia** preserves traces of multiple civilizations.  
Across this region, one can experience everything from **Mediterranean coastal landscapes** to the **ancient grandeur of Ottoman cities**, with historical ruins scattered throughout the land. There is simply too much worth visiting.

Popular destinations include **Istanbul, Izmir, Bursa, Fethiye, Antalya, Pamukkale, and Cappadocia**.

Due to time constraints, our itinerary was relatively tight. We chose to focus on three representative regions:
- **Istanbul** — a historical metropolis bridging Europe and Asia  
- **Cappadocia** — famous for its unique landscapes and hot air balloon experience  
- **Antalya** — a Mediterranean city combining ancient ruins with coastal scenery  

### Practical Notes
- **Visa**: Turkey offers an **e-visa** system. The official website requires only an online form and payment. Approval is almost instant. No supporting documents (such as flight tickets or hotel bookings) are required.  
- **Currency & Payment**: It is recommended to bring **USD or EUR** to exchange for Turkish Lira. **WeChat Pay and Alipay are generally not accepted**. Credit cards are widely accepted in most places; **HSBC cards offer very competitive exchange rates**, often better than cash.  
- **Transportation**: Domestic flights within Turkey are convenient and relatively inexpensive. Long-distance buses are also a viable and affordable option.

## 📝 Travel Notes & Comments — Cappadocia / Antalya / Istanbul

| City | Accommodation | Activity | Prices | Others |
| --- | ------------- | -------- | ------ | ------ |
| Cappadocia (Göreme / Uçhisar) | Göreme is very small; hotels are close to each other and conditions are quite similar. Prices in Göreme are relatively high. Uçhisar is very close to Göreme but noticeably cheaper. | Horse riding and hot air balloon are **highly recommended** — truly once-in-a-lifetime experiences. Most activities include **free hotel pickup** from both Göreme and Uçhisar. | Göreme prices are high; Uçhisar offers better value for similar distance and access. | Cash payments often get discounts. **A101 supermarket** near the Göreme bus station is extremely cheap — great for buying water and daily supplies (about **1/3 of outside prices**). Strongly recommended. |
| Antalya | Lara area offers sea-view resorts but prices are higher. Traffic congestion is heavy in the evening. Staying near Old Town provides much better value. | Old Town is walkable to the **ancient Roman harbor** and beach, perfect for sunset views. Day tours to **three ancient cities** are highly recommended; guided and well-organized. Pamukkale day tour is also a good option. | Antalya is one of the **cheapest cities** in Turkey. Strongly recommended to enjoy Turkish kebabs, pomegranate juice, and ice cream — much cheaper than other cities. | Old Town area offers the **best balance of price and experience**. Eat as much Turkish kebab as possible here. |
| Istanbul | Stayed near **Taksim Square** — very convenient transportation. Walking through Istiklal Street reaches **Galata Tower**, and crossing the bridge leads to the European Old City. Many reasonably priced convenience stores and restaurants nearby. | **Bosphorus cruise is a must-do.** Mosques are free to enter and highly recommended: Ortaköy Mosque (neo-classical, seaside), Blue Mosque (classical Ottoman), Yeni Mosque. | European Old City is expensive. Restaurants may charge service fees. Attractions are very costly — **Topkapi Palace + Dolmabahçe Palace together cost nearly 700 RMB per person**. | Locals feel very different from other cities: more price-sensitive, no rounding even for 1 lira. Scams are common — **strongly recommend learning common scams in advance**. Mustafa (1864) baklava and chicken pudding are worth trying. |
